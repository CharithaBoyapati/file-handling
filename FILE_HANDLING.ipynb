        " 1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        "    - Compiled languages execute pre-translated machine code, while interpreted languages execute code line by line at runtime.\n",
        " 2.  What is exception handling in Python\n",
        "    -  Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that occur during program execution, preventing crashes and allowing for graceful recovery.\n",
        " 3.   What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "    - The purpose of the finally block in exception handling is to execute cleanup code that needs to run regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's typically used to release resources like closing files or releasing locks, ensuring proper cleanup even if errors are raised during the try block.\n",
        " 4. What is logging in Python\n",
        "     - Logging in Python is the process of recording events, errors, warnings, and informational messages during program execution. It helps developers monitor, debug, and maintain applications by providing a structured way to track what happens while the code runs. Python’s logging module offers flexible tools to create, manage, and format logs at different levels of severity.\n",
        " 5.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "     - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. Its main significance is to perform cleanup actions, such as releasing resources (files, network connections) before the object is removed from memory. However, reliance on __del__ can be tricky due to unpredictable garbage collection timing, so it's often better to use context managers.\n",
        " 6.  What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",
        "     - import: Loads the entire module; access functions or variables with module_name.function_name.\n",
        "     - from ... import: Imports specific components (functions, classes, variables) directly into the current namespace, allowing direct use without prefixing with the module name.\n",
        " 7.  How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python\n",
        "     - You can handle multiple exceptions in Python by specifying multiple exception types in a single except clause using a tuple\n",
        " 8.  What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python\n",
        "     - The with statement simplifies file handling by automatically managing resource cleanup. When used with files, it ensures the file is properly closed automatically, even if an error occurs, preventing resource leaks and making the code cleaner and safer.\n",
        " 9.  What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        "     -  Multithreading: Multiple threads run within a single process, sharing memory; suitable for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
        "     - Multiprocessing: Multiple processes run independently, each with its own memory space; ideal for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        " 10.  What are the advantages of using logging in a program\n",
        "      - Debugging\n",
        "      - Monitoring\n",
        "      - Error tracking\n",
        "      - Auditing\n",
        " 11.  What is memory management in Python\n",
        "      - Memory management in Python refers to how the language handles allocation, deallocation, and organization of memory for objects during program execution. Python uses automatic memory management, primarily through reference counting and a garbage collector to free unused objects, ensuring efficient use of memory without explicit intervention by the programmer.\n",
        " 12.  What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",
        "      -  try block: Write code that may raise an exception.\n",
        "      - except block: Handle specific exceptions if they occur.\n",
        "      - Optional else: Run code if no exceptions are raised.\n",
        "      - finally block: Execute cleanup code regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
        " 13.  Why is memory management important in Python\n",
        "      - Memory management is important in Python because it ensures efficient use of system resources, prevents memory leaks, and maintains the overall stability and performance of applications. Proper memory handling helps in managing the lifecycle of objects, avoiding crashes, and optimizing the program’s speed and responsiveness\n",
        " 14.  What is the role of try and except in exception handling\n",
        "      - The try block contains code that might raise an exception, while the except block specifies how to handle specific or general exceptions that occur within the try. Together, they enable graceful error handling, preventing program crashes and allowing for controlled recovery or informative error messages.\n",
        " 15.  How does Python's garbage collection system work\n",
        "       -  Python's garbage collection system primarily works through reference counting: each object has a count of references pointing to it, and when this count drops to zero, the object is immediately deallocated. Additionally, Python includes a cyclic garbage collector to detect and collect groups of objects involved in reference cycles that are no longer reachable, ensuring efficient memory cleanup even when objects reference each other.\n",
        " 16.  What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        "      -  The else block in exception handling runs only if no exceptions are raised in the try block. Its purpose is to execute code that should run when the try succeeds without errors, often for actions dependent on the successful execution of the try block, keeping error handling and success logic separate for clearer code flow.\n",
        " 17.   What are the common logging levels in Python\n",
        "      - DEBUG\n",
        "      - INFO\n",
        "      - WARNING\n",
        "      - ERROR\n",
        "      - CRITICAL                             \n",
        " 18.   What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n",
        "      - os.fork() is lower-level, system-dependent, and more manual.\n",
        "      - multiprocessing offers a more user-friendly, cross-platform interface for parallel execution.\n",
        " 19.  What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n",
        "      -  Frees system resources\n",
        " 20.  What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
        "      - file.read(): Reads the entire file at once (or can specify a specific number of bytes).\n",
        "      - file.readline(): Reads one line each invocation, including the newline character at the end.  \n",
        " 21.  What is the logging module in Python used for\n",
        "      - The logging module in Python is used for tracking and recording events that happen during program execution.\n",
        " 22.  What is the os module in Python used for in file handling\n",
        "      -  Navigating directories (os.chdir(), os.getcwd())\n",
        "      - Creating, deleting, and renaming files and directories (os.remove(), os.mkdir(), os.rename())\n",
        "      - Checking file or directory existence and properties (os.path.exists(), os.path.getsize())\n",
        " 23.  What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python\n",
        "      -  Memory leaks\n",
        "      -  Memory growth\n",
        "      - Garbage collection overhead\n",
        "      - Handling large data\n",
        "      - Limited low-level control\n",
        " 24.  How do you raise an exception manually in Python\n",
        "      - In Python, you can manually raise an exception using the raise keyword. This is useful when you want to signal an error condition in your program.\n",
        " 25.  Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "     - Enhanced Performance: Multithreading enables parallel execution, making better use of CPU resources, especially on multi-core processors.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Improved Responsiveness: In applications like GUIs, multithreading ensures that background tasks (e.g., data processing) don’t freeze the user interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Efficient Resource Utilization: Threads share memory space, reducing overhead compared to creating separate processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Better Handling of I/O Operations: Multithreading is useful for applications that involve network requests, file handling,                                                      \n",
